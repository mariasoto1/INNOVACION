                    <p>1.The Design Thinking project proposal is oriented to the Human, has feasibility and is functional. And they are involved:

We chose this idea since two compañeras of our group live in apartments which are of small dimensions, besides that nowadays most of the families live in these apartments with limited space. The project objective will be to provide the necessary furniture creating accessible spaces without having to do without some things because of the limited space. </p>
                     <p>  2.	The proposal is of high social, economic impact:
It will greatly help society so that they can feel comfortable in apartments with limited space, as well as being affordable furniture for all.</p>
                      <p> 3.	The work team has the competences to develop the project:
The team has the help of a carpenter (father of a member) expert in manufacturing furniture for the home.</p>
                      <p> 4.	The proposal is based on the reality and opportunities for innovation within the region:
Even in our region these furniture is not offered, so it is an opportunity for innovation with help to society</p>
